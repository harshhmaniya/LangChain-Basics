page_content='In recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the
world. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our
industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and, in nearly all cases, we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce
the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our
products, and additional measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a
whole.' metadata={'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'creationdate': '2023-07-20T16:22:00-04:00', 'title': '0000320187-23-000039', 'author': 'EDGAR Online, a division of Donnelley Financial Solutions', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2023-07-20 for the period ending 2023-05-31', 'keywords': '0000320187-23-000039; ; 10-K', 'moddate': '2023-07-20T16:22:08-04:00', 'source': 'Sample PDFs/nke-10k-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 107, 'page': 6, 'page_label': '7', 'start_index': 2900}
